{"prompt":"I'm interested in understanding the vegetation health of a particular place over a certain time frame. I've heard about the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and would like to use it. In the context of satellite imagery, NDVI is an index of plant 'greenness' or photosynthetic activity. It is one of the most commonly used vegetation indices for estimating terrestrial vegetation vigor. The NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation absorbs most of the visible light that hits it and reflects a large portion of the near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation reflects more visible light and less near-infrared light. The NDVI is calculated from these individual measurements as follows: NDVI = (NIR - Red ) \/ (NIR + Red) where Red and NIR stand for the spectral reflectance measurements acquired in the red (visible) and near-infrared regions, respectively. These spectral reflectances are themselves ratios of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band individually, hence they take on values between 0.0 and 1.0. I would like to compute NDVI for the past three months. Can you help me with that?","response":"Sure, I can help you compute the NDVI for the past three months.

{"prompt":"I have a set of aerial images taken last summer that are unfortunately filled with cloud cover. These images were taken over a span of two weeks.
